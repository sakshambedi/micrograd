This project is a personal exploration and implementation of a simplified tensor library, inspired by [tinygrad](https://github.com/geohot/tinygrad) and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/). The primary goal is to understand the fundamental concepts and mechanics behind modern deep learning frameworks by building one from scratch.

## What is this?

**micrograd** is a Python-based library that provides a `Tensor` object, similar to those found in NumPy, PyTorch, or TensorFlow. It aims to replicate some of the core functionalities, particularly focusing on automatic differentiation and tensor operations, to gain a deeper insight into their inner workings.

This is an educational project. While the aim is to create functional components, it's not intended to be a production-ready deep learning library.

## Current Features

As of now, `micrograd` supports:

### Tensor Creation and Data Types

- **Multiple creation methods:**
  - Python lists or tuples: `Tensor([1, 2, 3])`
  - Single values (scalars): `Tensor(5)` or `Tensor(3.14)`
  - Empty tensors: `Tensor(None)` (creates a scalar tensor with value 0)
- **Comprehensive data type support:**
  - `float32`, `float16`, `float64` for floating-point numbers
  - `int32`, `int16`, `int8` for signed integers
  - `uint16`, `uint8` for unsigned integers
  - `bool` for boolean values
  - Automatic platform handling for `float16` (including systems without native support)
- **Factory methods:**
  - `Tensor.ones((2, 3))` - Create tensors filled with ones
  - `Tensor.zeros((2, 3))` - Create tensors filled with zeros
  - `Tensor.full((2, 3), value)` - Create tensors filled with a specific value
  - `Tensor.arange(start, end, step)` - Create 1D tensors with sequential values
  - `Tensor.randn(*shape)` - Create tensors with random normal distribution
- **Automatic shape inference from nested structures**

### Mathematical Operations

- **Binary arithmetic operations:**
  - Addition (`+`), Subtraction (`-`), Multiplication (`*`), Division (`/`), Power (`**`)
  - All operations support element-wise computation between tensors of the same shape
  - Proper error handling for shape mismatches and division by zero
- **Unary operations:**
  - Negation (`-tensor`)
  - Support for double negation and chaining operations
- **Reduction operations:**
  - `Tensor.sum()` with dtype preservation and gradient tracking
  - `Tensor.mean()` (planned implementation)
- **Advanced operations:**
  - Element-wise operations with proper type casting and upsampling
  - Special value handling (infinity, NaN, subnormal numbers)

### Memory Management and Performance

- **Advanced buffer management:**
  - Memory pooling system with configurable pool sizes
  - Thread-safe buffer allocation and deallocation
  - Memory pressure monitoring with optional `psutil` integration
  - Buffer reuse for improved performance

  - Contiguous memory layout using `memoryview` and `array.array`
  - Platform-optimized float16 handling
  - Zero-copy operations where possible

### Shape Manipulation and Views

- **Reshaping operations:**
  - `view(*shape)` / `reshape(*shape)` for changing tensor shapes
  - `transpose(dim0, dim1)` for swapping dimensions
  - `Tensor.T(tensor)` static method for 2D tensor transpose
  - `Tensor.permute(tensor, *indices)` for arbitrary dimension reordering
- **Advanced indexing:**
  - Multi-dimensional indexing: `tensor[0, 1]` for 2D tensors
  - Negative indexing support: `tensor[-1]`
  - Assignment through indexing: `tensor[0, 1] = value`
- **Stride manipulation:**
  - Direct access to tensor strides via `stride()` method
  - Non-contiguous tensor support through advanced stride handling
  - Automatic contiguity management

### Automatic Differentiation System

- **Gradient tracking:**
  - `requires_grad` attribute for enabling gradient computation
  - `grad` attribute for storing computed gradients
  - `grad_fn` attribute tracking computation history
- **Function-based autograd system:**
  - Base `Function` class with forward/backward methods
  - Context saving mechanism for backpropagation
  - Implemented operations: Add, Sub, Mul, Div, Pow, Neg (forward pass complete)
  - Thread-local autograd state management
- **Gradient propagation:**
  - Automatic gradient requirement propagation through operations
  - Support for computational graph construction

### Data Conversion and Interoperability

- **NumPy integration:**
  - `to_numpy()` method for seamless NumPy array conversion
  - Automatic shape and dtype preservation
- **String representations:**
  - Comprehensive `__repr__` showing shape, dtype, device, and data
  - Clean `__str__` for data visualization
  - Nested list representation matching tensor structure

### Device Support Framework

- **Device abstraction:**
  - Device class for future multi-device support
  - `device` attribute on tensors
  - Foundation for GPU computation (future work)

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- **Robust error handling:**
  - Shape mismatch detection and reporting
  - Division by zero handling (returns infinity following NumPy behavior)
  - Index out of bounds protection
  - Inconsistent tensor shape validation
- **Special value support:**
  - Proper handling of infinity, negative infinity, and NaN
  - Zero-size tensor operations
  - Subnormal number handling in float16
